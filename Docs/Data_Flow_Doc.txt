Data Flow:
1) The measuremennt processor/matlab simulator is generating the FUSION .txt file:
	"data/obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-ukf-input.txt";
	OR
	"../matlab_examples/obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-ukf-input.txt";

The Input file format is:
#L(for laser) meas_px meas_py timestamp gt_px gt_py gt_vx gt_vy
#R(for radar) meas_rho meas_phi meas_rho_dot timestamp gt_px gt_py gt_vx gt_vy

Example:
R	8.60363	0.0290616	-2.99903	1477010443399637	8.6	0.25	-3.00029	0
L	8.45	0.25	1477010443349642	8.45	0.25	-3.00027	0
	
2) The UKF Algorithm reads form file reads all the lines and generates measurement structures
3) The MeasurementProcessor() is called with individual measurements (one by one). The results are saved
(Attention: no file processing routines are used inside MeasurementProcessor() all the file processing routines are in the main function
So the data read/write is decoupled from the algorithm
4) The results are saved in an output file:
"output/state_estimate.txt"

Output file format:
time_stamp px_state py_state v_state yaw_angle_state yaw_rate_state sensor_type NIS px_measured py_measured px_ground_truth py_ground_truth vx_ground_truth vy_ground_truth
